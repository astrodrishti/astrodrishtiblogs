                    worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that relates humanity to
                    supernatural, transcendental, or spiritual elementsDifferent religions may or may not contain
                    various elements ranging from the divine,sacred things, faith,a supernatural being or supernatural

                    life There are several kinds of relegions around the world that people preach.the include
                    Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and janism. But if I tell you that there are many more
                    relegions in around the globe and those are considered as taboo among many societies. Here you’ll be
                    reading about one such bizzare relegion. This may even excite you if you are a sci-fi fan. This
                    relegion is called Raëlism</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 font-semibold mb-4 mt-4">"Raëlism"
                </h2>

                <p class="pb-6">Raëlism,also known as Raëlianism, is a UFO religion that was founded in 1970s France by
                    Claude Vorilhon, now known as Raël.</p>

                <p class="pb-6">Raëlism teaches that an extraterrestrial species known as the Elohim created humanity
                    using their advanced technology. An atheistic religion, it believes that the Elohim have
                    historically been mistaken for gods. It holds that throughout history the Elohim have created forty
                    Elohim/human hybrids who have served as prophets preparing humanity for news about their ultimate
                    origins. Among those listed as prophets are The Buddha, Jesus of Nazareth, and Muhammad, with Raël
                    himself being the fortieth and final prophet. Raëlists believe that since the Hiroshima bomb of
                    1945, humanity has entered an Age of Apocalypse in which it is threatening itself with nuclear
                    annihilation. It argues that humanity must find a way of harnessing new scientific and technological
                    development for peaceful ends, and that once this has been achieved the Elohim shall return to Earth
                    to share their technology with humanity and usher in a utopia. To this end, the Raëlians have been
                    committed to building an embassy for the Elohim, incorporating a landing pad for the latter's
                    spaceship. Raëlians promote a liberal ethical system with a strong emphasis on sexual
                    experimentation, engage in daily meditation, and hope for physical immortality through human
                    cloning. </p>

                <p class="pb-6">The religion is based on the teachings of Raël. Raël's claims are taken literally by
                    practitioners of Raëlism. Raëlism teaches that there exists an extraterrestrial species known as the
                    Elohim. Raël stated that the word "Elohim", which is used for God in the Old Testament, is actually
                    a plural term which he translates as meaning "those who came from the sky. Individual members of the
                    Elohim are referred to as "Eloha" by Raël. He alleged that these aliens gave him the honorific name
                    of "Raël". A term deriving from "Israel", and which he translates as meaning "the messenger of those
                    who come from the sky." </p>

                <div class="border-l-4 border-gray-500 pl-4 mb-6 italic rounded">
                    “I am no bird and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.”
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 font-semibold mb-4 mt-4">"Earth’s Elohim "
                </h2>

                <p class="pb-6">Raëlism teaches that around 25,000 years ago the Elohim arrived at the Earth and
                    terraformed it so that biological life could emerge. It states that the Elohim used their advanced
                    technology to establish all life on the planet. Raël characterises humans as "biological robots"
                    that have been created and programmed by the ElohimVarious figures who established or inspired
                    religious movements throughout human history, including Jesus, the Buddha, Muhammad, and Joseph
                    Smith, are portrayed by the Raëlians as having been guided by the Elohim. These are characterised as
                    being 39 prophets sent to humanity at various points. Each is believed to have revealed information
                    to humanity that they could comprehend at the given time, and Raëlism therefore emphasises the idea
                    of progressive .
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 font-semibold mb-4 mt-4">"Cloning and survival after death."
                </h2>
                <p class="pb-6">Raëlians reject the existence of the ethereal soul that survives physical death,and
                    instead argue that the only hope for immortality is through scientific means. The Raëlians claim
                    that the Elohim will clone and thus recreate dead individuals, but only those whom they feel merit
                    this recreation. In this, they believe in a "conditional immortality", with immortality for a
                    minority and oblivion for the majority. The resurrection of Jesus, as recounted in the Gospels, is
                    for instance explained as an example of Elohim cloning.</p>
                <p class="pb-6">There is much more about this relegion that if I would have covered would take a
                    siginfcant amount time. These are just some amazing facts about this group. What is your opinion
                    about this. Do u really think that so called ‘ELOHIM’created us. Good luck. </p>
