                <p class="pb-6">Honestly I never really believed in astrology. Why ? Its's simple. I always thought that
                    the astologers were making things up and scaring other people for their own selfish reasons. And I
                    can't say that It's entirely wrong. There are many astrologers who use troubled people to make a
                    profit but I believe that there are many other astrologers who truly wish to help people.</p>

                <p class="pb-6">Coming back to the topic, I belong to a Brahmin family so many of my relatives know
                    astrology but I was never interested in it. No one told me to learn it and since now we are getting
                    more an more advanced many people are forgetting about our ancient knowledge that our great sages
                    once possessed. During the quarantine I had nothing else to do so I thought why not give astrology a
                    try. I downloaded an astrology app and started looking at my own Horoscope. At first I was perplexed
                    that what were the numbers written on diferent blocks and how can I even understand all this, what
                    does each planet even represent and other similar doubts so I started researching on this topic.</p>

                <p class="pb-6">I started reading books by B.V Raman, Mantreswara, Brihat Parashara etc. and even saw
                    various videos on Youtube regarding Astrology and I came to realise that astrology was very much
                    true. I startd lookinhg at the events that occured in my life and then analyzing the Mahadashas of
                    Planets according to my Kundli. I started interpreting the Planets and their positions and concluded
                    that somehow I was forced to act in ways that the planets wanted (Sound weird right ?) yeilding
                    results that the placement of planets were already representing. Now I don't want to force this on
                    anyone that you MUST belive in Astrology, that's not what I intend to do here. I am simply sharing
                    my experience with you and one thing should always be remembered, a strong will power and a good
                    determination will always help an individual no matter what! It is beieved that a soul is
                    reincarnated in this world again and again until he has done all his work and then he attains
                    Moksha.</p>

                <div class="border-l-4 border-gray-500 pl-4 mb-6 italic rounded">
                    “The soul of the newly born baby is marked for life by the pattern of the stars at the moment it
                    comes into the world, unconsciously remembers it, and remains sensitive to the return of
                    configurations of a similar kind.”
                </div>

                <p class="pb-6">We all are stuck in an endless cycle of life and birth and what we did in our previous
                    life determines our next birth. Astrology tells us that what it is that we didn't complete in our
                    previous life and through that we can make our actions good in this life. If we end up doing bad
                    things in this life then we will surely suffer a bad fate in our next life. I personally also
                    believe that Astrology is a way to get to know our flaws and to work on them. For example, if a
                    planet (Let's Say Saturn) is bad for you then it doesn't mean that you'll just get pain and
                    sufferings during its Mahadasha. It means that during it's Mahadasha, infact in your entire life,
                    you must be disciplined and hardworking. You should always work hard and not feel lazy since that
                    will help you to attain your goals.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 font-semibold mb-4 mt-4">At last !
                </h2>

                <p class="pb-6">You must indulge in good actions too. This way you can control your malefic Saturn and
                    take it's belssings. I hope now you understand that why I suddenly got a keen interest in astrology.
                    It answered many of the questions I had on my mind.</p>

                <p class="pb-6">And I truly believe that we can help you get answers of your questions too. For you we
                    are always here and I really hope that we will be able to bestow a little bit of our positivity on
                    you. May god bless us all !</p>
