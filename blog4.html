                <p class="pb-6">In this modern era we believe in science, technology, etc. But when we are not able to
                    complete a work, or I can say we want the luck in our favour we just simply say "PLEASE HELP ME
                    GOD". Now here we are asking an entity for help which we have never seen, but we believe. Now
                    question can be simply answered that GOD is nothing but a belief and belief can never be seen, it
                    can only be felt. Now for making this article more interesting we can discuss about what type of
                    belief is this or how it is developed, what is basis of this all, how majority of people believe in
                    GOD even without a single proof. Lets Start..</p>

                <p class="pb-6">See I believe in "KARMA" but we can relate this word with GOD belief. Whenever our
                    parents or grandparents talk about GOD, they usually tells us good stories , how they saved people
                    from bad persons, how they spread love so that everyone becomes a good person, how they used to to
                    charities for poor ones, their friendships like "Krishna and Sudama", 5 Pandavas against a full
                    army, Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. All this is indicating that person should be good from his heart,
                    he should never betray someone, help poor, etc to make this world a better place to live. </p>

                <p class="pb-6">Also this is indicating when a person shows his bad side, he/she earns bad "KARMAS"
                    which he/she has to pay in future. All this is said to us about GOD that he always helps a person
                    who helps others and punishes one doing wrong thing. See how "KARMA" and belief of GOD is the same
                    thing. </p>

                <div class="border-l-4 border-gray-500 pl-4 mb-6 italic rounded">
                    “God is like gravity. You don't have to believe in it for him to be in your life.”
                </div>

                <p class="pb-6">One more theory says that GOD is in every thing, but again question comes that how to
                    prove this also. Reason behind the statement is to add values in people about how to treat others.
                    They must be treated in a good way keeping in mind that he/she maybe some other avatar of GOD. This
                    one statement was also the reason for whole Ramayana. In early times giving biksha to sadhus was
                    counted as a very good deed, but with increasing crime this belief of people is fading away and they
                    usually tend to ignore these type of help these days.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 font-semibold mb-4 mt-4">"So whether there is God ? or it's just a
                    belief."
                </h2>
                <p class="pb-6">Now the answer of this question can vary from person to person. Some believe in GOD,
                    some believe in GOD only and few do not believe in anything. But at the end I want to say whether
                    GOD exists or not we should follow the path taught by them as the things told in our sacred books
                    are not harmful for humanity at all, because they will ultimately lead us in a good direction
                    towards success only. </p>
