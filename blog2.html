                <p class="pb-6">So first I want to ask a question that what comes in your mind when someone tells you
                    about his/her profession. The answer is simple , an image related to work done in that particular
                    profession. But what if i say an astrologer, the image is of a pandit ji doing pooja and if i say
                    an engineer, the image is of a person going to work in formal shirt and trousers. But the
                    interesting
                    thing is that the developers of this app are engineers and astrologers simultaneously.</p>

                <p class="pb-6">Being one of the developer of this project with my co-developer we are one of this kind
                    , started engineering in 2018, my co-developer and friend being from a pandit family
                    developed interest in Astrology . One day he told me that he can read Kundli i.e. kind of a birth
                    chart. At that time i was like bro what are you doing and started laughing, also the chart seems to
                    me like a whole different language so actually i was like, i dont want to go in this stuff. But then
                    he asked for DOB, birth time and all, that was not a problem for me so i gave him and next day he
                    was telling me about my past life and things were actually matching the way i lived. The guy met me
                    in engineering so how could he know that much, I was shocked and that was the thing which developed
                    my interest in astrology. </p>

                <p class="pb-6">After that he also told me about my future, like career, health, wealth, etc and all the
                    things he was telling me made me more and more happier which was 2nd reason I want to learn more
                    about astrology. He started me telling about lagna first and what is influence of it in our life. I
                    still remember we used to discuss all these things while travelling in local buses from our college
                    to home. There were a lot of weird reactions from people in buses, that these guys are showing
                    interest in such a mature study done by mostly Pandits but we never cared about that and used to
                    discuss a lot. I daily tried to gain more and more knowledge of all these things and used to
                    diagnose kundlis of random students from college and in 10-15 days i was like that i can predict ,
                    not very deeply but yes now i know what is this weird looking chart.</p>

                <div class="border-l-4 border-gray-500 pl-4 mb-6 italic rounded">
                    “I believe in a lot of astrology. I believe in aliens…I look up into the stars and I imagine: ‘How
                    self-important are we to think that we are the only life-form?”
                </div>

                <p class="pb-6">After that I sarted loosing my interest in all these stuff as i started learning a new
                    programming knowledge, but my friend, he was day by day becoming more expert in this field and great
                    thing was that he never took a single penny from anyone to see his birth chart as taken by many
                    astrologers, he did all this for practice. But we both marely talked about astrology in that month.

                <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 font-semibold mb-4 mt-4">Lockdown The Game Changer!
                </h2>

                <p class="pb-6">The game changed when Lockdown started, it was like a very good chance for CSE students
                    to learn. So I started learning different languages and after a month time made me learn about
                    python
                    as a programming language and flutter for mobile App development. After a while my friend asked me
                    to
                    make an app of kundli to which I merely showed interest and said there are many others but he then
                    told
                    me to make an app which can also read kundli with a single tap. The idea suddenly striked my mind
                    and i started
                    working on it taking idea as a good project to practice, but ended up making an app which can
                    actually read
                    and check planets and there positions influencing users life with which I started adding more
                    features
                    into it.</p>

                <p class="pb-6">While making that app I again studied about astrology and again same things happened, we
                    started discussing more and more on chat apps and now whether I am not as good as my friend but can
                    see birth chart and how planets are influencing person's life. At last I want to say that astrology
                    is nothing
                    but reality.Some people dont show interest but fact is that "यह सत्य है".</p>
